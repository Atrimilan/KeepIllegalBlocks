#### Overview

* Fix some `MULTI_BLOCK_CHANGE` packets that were not being sent correctly. They are now tweaked to only disable packets
  that replace fragile blocks with air.
    * This fixes redstone and rails _(and probably other fragile blocks)_ that weren't updating on client sides.
    * This also fixes fragile doors from flickering.
* Change the Modrinth publishing system.
    * The [mc-publish](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mc-publish) GitHub action has been replaced by the
      Modrinth's [Minotaur](https://github.com/modrinth/minotaur) Gradle task.
